# libdiscord
A library to automate some things in Discord

### NOTE:
At this point and time there's only one function to send messages in the library, I will be updating it

## How To use
On Visual Studio 2019:
**Project -> Add Project Refrence... -> Browse** and find `libdiscord.dll`

And you're done...
To access the library's functions use `libdiscord.<the function>(<parameters>)`

Also you don't need to add `using libdiscord;`
